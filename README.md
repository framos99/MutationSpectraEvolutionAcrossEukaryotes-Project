# Mutation Spectra Evolution Across Eukaryotes
## Overview
This repository contains all code for generating and analyzing context-specific mutation spectra across a broad range of eukaryotic species. It includes:
- A pipeline for preparing input data for mutation spectra inference with Baymer (`BaymerPipeline.py`)
- Template scripts for applying Baymer to mutation and context counts data
- Utility scripts for data processing and format conversion (`UtilityScripts/`).
- Parallelized repeat masking of genomes (`parallelized_repeatmasking.py`).
- Precomputed tree files and RMarkdown for figure generation.
- Example figure notebooks and output figure files.
